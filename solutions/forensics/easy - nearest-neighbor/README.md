Original Prompt:

I thought I remembered this wallpaper being a lot smaller?

I hate this challenge.

Basically, you're supposed to notice that there are dark pixels spaced every 16 pixels in a grid in certain parts of the image.
Combining this with hints from the description and the name of the challenge, *clearly* you're meant to 
downscale the image using nearest neighbor scaling by a factor of 16 to discard all but the darker pixels in the corner,
at which point the patterns and text becomes obvious.
