This service listens on port 4113. When you connect, you send three things:

1. A filename to edit
2. An offset to edit
3. New content

That's it! The binary itself cannot be edited on disk, and that's pretty much
the only file we've added. The challenge is to figure out what to do with a
write-anywhere primitive.

Good luck!
