This challenge's Docker file is for-sure broken as-is, at least when I build it today.
The user's home directory has inaccessible permissions.
I'm fairly confident this was intended to be nothing more than a sanity check question where you type the following:

```bash
nc localhost 8080
# cat ~/flag.txt
```
