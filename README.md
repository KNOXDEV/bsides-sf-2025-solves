# Solves for BSidesSF CTF 2025

This is my attempt to aggregate my solutions to challenges from BSidesSF CTF into one place.

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/KNOXDEV/bsides-sf-2025-solves.git
```

The submodule is the challenge code, which is necessary for running the solutions.

I use Nix to manage my development environment. To get my environment:

```bash
nix develop
```
